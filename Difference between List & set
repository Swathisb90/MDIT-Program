* Lists allows duplicates i.e list can consists of the element multiple times whereas Sets do not allow duplicates where each element value is unique.
* Lists maintain the order of elements as they are added, whereas Sets do not guarantee any particular order.
* Set is implemented by - HashSet, linkedhastset, Treeset however List is implemented by ArrayList, Vector & Linkedlist
* Set is extened by SortedSet
* List allows you to iterate over its elements using an iterator or a for-each loop, while Set also allows iteration but does not guarantee the order of its elements during iteration.
* List elements can be  accessed using their index position, using methods like get() and set(). Set does not allow index-based access because it does not maintain any specific order.
* Example 
//.    List<String> myList = new ArrayList<>();
        Set<String> mySet = new HashSet<>();
        List.add("Pencil");
        List.add("Sharper");
        Set.add("Pencil");
        Set.add("Pencil");
System.out.println("Element at index 1 in list: " + List.get(1));
 System.out.println("Set elements using for-each loop:");
for (String element : Set) {
            System.out.println(element);
        }
----
o/p
Element at index 1 in list: Sharper
Set elements using for-each loop:
Pencil 

// Out put prints only one element for set as it consits of duplicate also set cannot be accessed using the mentionedget
