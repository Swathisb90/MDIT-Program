The optimal number of nodes recommended for each Selenium Grid setup depends on various factors, including the complexity of your tests, the desired testing speed, available hardware resources, and budget considerations. There is no one-size-fits-all answer, but I can provide you with some general guidelines for different grid sizes based on common setups:

Small Grid:

Grid Size: 2-5 nodes
Recommended Use Case: Small-scale testing with a limited number of browsers and platforms. Suitable for basic functional testing and smoke testing.
Medium Grid:

Grid Size: 6-15 nodes
Recommended Use Case: Medium-sized test suites with a variety of browsers and platforms. Good for functional and regression testing.
Large Grid:

Grid Size: 16+ nodes
Recommended Use Case: Extensive testing across a wide range of browsers, versions, and platforms. Useful for comprehensive regression testing and parallel execution of multiple test suites
